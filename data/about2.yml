title : DELIVERY|CONF 2020
description : DELIVERY|CONF 2020 is a not-for-profit event being created by an all-volunteer team with many years of experience both in technology and with creating conferences.
description2 : DELIVERY|CONF 2020 is being held to give people a place to get deeper technical information about Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). Our goal isn't to just tell you to "do the technical thing"; it is to show you real world examples of how others have done it.
