###  CICD-ing My VAX 

When people hear “VAX assembly,” they immediately assume an application deployed once every year or two and developed using waterfall and a collection of antiquated technology practices. In this case, those are some very incorrect assumptions. Ticketmaster’s core ticketing engine is an almost 45-year-old platform primarily written in VAX assembly yet developed and deployed in a remarkably modern way (despite the fact that no modern CICD tools are built with VAX assembly in mind). They said it couldn’t be done, but we achieved continuous integration and frequent releases. Join this session to find out how!
