Ryan works with some of Octopus Deploy's largest customers to help them be successful in their continuous delivery efforts. He is also active in the broader Octopus community answering questions in Slack, recording videos for the Ask Octopus series, and visiting conferences and user groups to speak about CI/CD and Octopus Deploy.

Before joining the Customer Success team at Octopus, Ryan was a developer and happy Octopus Deploy user. He's always taken an interest in improving processes and automating tasks where possible. This naturally led him to CI/CD and a several phase project to improve his team's build and deploy pipeline. By the end, his team had a fully automated build and deploy process that integrated with our other tools through APIs. They even had recurring scheduled deployments to keep our test and demo environments up to date.

Outside of developing and advocating, Ryan performs comedy around Dallas, belongs to two needy cats, and likes to travel to new places and sampling their vegan food.

###  How we fixed our broken deployment process 

The year is 2013. My team develops a web application with a mix of modern and very legacy components. Our deployments were a mess. They were cumbersome, error prone, and time consuming. Most deployments caused some level of system instability afterwards. And that was just our production deployments! Refreshing any development or test system was a challenge that could derail a developer's day. Something had to change.

This is the story about that change. In this session, I'll talk about the tools and patterns that we adopted, the results that we had, and the lessons we learned along the way.

Concepts covered:

- Iteration Zero
- Build Systems
- Automated Deployments
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery
