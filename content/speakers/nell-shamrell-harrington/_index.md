###  Trust But Verify - Third Party Dependencies in Your Pipeline 

Many companies have moved away from "Not Invented Here" syndrome to making liberal use of third party dependencies for parts of their software - this is a good thing! However, when you depend on third party projects to build and run your code (including in automatic pipelines), there are certain precautions you must take. It is wonderful to use Open Source dependencies - but how do you prepare for a situation where the source suddenly becomes unavailable? What if a security vulnerability is introduced into one of your dependencies? How do you maintain the integrity of your applications when they use third party libraries? And, perhaps most important, how do you keep track of all of your dependencies and prevent things like container images from becoming black boxes? Come to this talk to hear real world examples of each of these scenarios and learn how to integrate verification of your trusted dependencies directly into your CI/CD pipelines.
