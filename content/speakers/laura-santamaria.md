As LogDNA’s Developer Advocate, Laura Santamaria loves to learn and explain how things work. She bridges the gap between external developers and SREs and internal engineering teams. Prior to LogDNA, Laura worked as a software developer at Rackspace where, among other things, she owned Deconst, an open-source documentation delivery platform, and MC’ed Rackspace’s internal technical conference. Apart from work, she helps host tech Meetups, teaches Python for Women Who Code Austin, and volunteers with DevOpsDays Austin. Outside of tech, Laura runs, plays with her dogs, throws discs, and watches clouds—the real kind.

###  Legacy is a Frame of Mind 

Have you ever been dropped into a legacy application that had some sort of pipeline in the past, but now you have to figure out how it works? I found myself in that situation, so let's talk about legacy pipelines and puzzling your way through resurrecting them based on what I learned and encountered along the way. We'll talk about good ideas and bad ideas when handling a legacy application from a CI/CD pipeline standpoint, understanding how a system is put together from logs and other data you (hopefully) can find—and what to do when you don't have any data at all,—and how to make that legacy application's pipeline more usable for the next maintainer down the line. And just maybe we'll unearth how to pull that legacy pipeline from the grave so that, while some people might still call the system legacy because it's old, the pipeline can show them a thing or two about modern CI/CD strategies.
