Brooke is a Transformation Lead at ANZ Bank in New Zealand where she works with technology teams to achieve their goals. Having started out her career in internal audit and risk advisory she still isn’t clear how she ended up being part of the technology community, but over the past three years she has been part of a technology transformation whereby continuous delivery has become the new normal. Brooke focuses primarily on key components required to effect organizational change in a safe and sustainable manner: people & process – acknowledging that very rarely is it sufficient to just “automate” existing processes in large organizations because they are no longer fit for purpose.
