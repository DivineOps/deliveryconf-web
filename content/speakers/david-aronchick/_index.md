I lead Open Source Machine Learning Strategy at Azure. This means I spend most of his time helping humans to convince machines to be smarter. I am only moderately successful at this.

Previously, I led product management for Kubernetes on behalf of Google, launched Google Kubernetes Engine, and co-founded the Kubeflow project. I have also worked at Microsoft, Amazon and Chef and co-founded three startups.

### CI/CD + ML == MLOps - The Way to Speed Bringing Machine Learning to Production

Have you ever strugged with having different environments to build, train and serve ML models, and how to orchestrate between them? While DevOps and GitOps have made huge traction in recent years, many customers struggle to apply these practices to ML workloads.

This talk will focus on ways to effectively infuse AI into production-grade applications through establishing practices around model reproducibility, validation, versioning/tracking, and safe/compliant deployment. We will demonstrate how to run an E2E machine learning system using nothing more than Git. This will integrate DevOps, data and ML pipelines together, and show how to use multiple workload orchestrators together.

While the examples will be run using Azure Pipelines, Azure ML and Kubeflow, we will also show how to extend these platforms to any orchestration tool.
