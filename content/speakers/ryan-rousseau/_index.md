Ryan works with some of Octopus Deploy's largest customers to help them be successful in their continuous delivery efforts. He is also active in the broader Octopus community answering questions in Slack, recording videos for the Ask Octopus series, and visiting conferences and user groups to speak about CI/CD and Octopus Deploy.

Before joining the Customer Success team at Octopus, Ryan was a developer and happy Octopus Deploy user. He's always taken an interest in improving processes and automating tasks where possible. This naturally led him to CI/CD and a several phase project to improve his team's build and deploy pipeline. By the end, his team had a fully automated build and deploy process that integrated with our other tools through APIs. They even had recurring scheduled deployments to keep our test and demo environments up to date.

Outside of developing and advocating, Ryan performs comedy around Dallas, belongs to two needy cats, and likes to travel to new places and sampling their vegan food.
