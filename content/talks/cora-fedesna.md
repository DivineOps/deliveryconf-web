Cora lives and codes in Chicago with her cats, spouse, and one deployed startup human. She loves a meaty code challenge and is not afraid to read a library's code base to fill-in what the documentation left out. While she started in Ruby and JavaScript, she now lives in the land of Java and loves to not block her threads.

### Lessons Learned when a Dev does Opsy Things

The story of a Dev wading into the land of ops to get her deployment environment created. The story starts in the land of terraforming. It's a different land for coding with scary and unfamiliar things like data blocks, IAM roles, and cidre. What is cidre? Well you can't drink it! She travels through the land of AWS console where to wind up in the running of laid tests to tune her services resources.

This talk is a discovery of terraforming, AWS dashboards, and the digging (datadog/logs) needed to tune a service with load tests. It will show code, there will be no live coding. In a story format, the talk walks the audience through these steps from the perspective of a Dev.
