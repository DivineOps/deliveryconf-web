"Build quality in" is the sixth of the eight principles of software delivery listed in Continuous Delivery. But what is quality, and how should we build it in? Drawing from research and their own experiences, Maryam and Jez will discuss how to evaluate quality, and strategies and tactics to build it in. In this talk you'll learn what you can measure to find out how you're doing, how to plan for quality, the impact of organizational and team structure and behavior, and technical- and process-based approaches to creating fast feedback loops.
