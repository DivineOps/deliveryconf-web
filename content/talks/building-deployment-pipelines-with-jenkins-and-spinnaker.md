The decision to leverage Spinnaker for CD doesn't require throwing away all of your existing DevOps tooling built around Jenkins, as Spinnaker has native Jenkins integrations. In this talk, we'll show how Spinnaker addresses continuous delivery requirements and supports automated canary analysis without additional scripting. Through a live demo, we'll approach tools commonly involved in CI/CD as lego pieces, and use Spinnaker to link them up and supercharge the delivery of pipelines as code.
