In the 10 years since the publication of the Continuous Delivery Book a lot has changed. Continuous Delivery has become a reality for many organisations all over the world and an aspiration for many more. Join the authors Dave & Jez to reflect on why Continuous Delivery has been such a successful concept, why it matters and where it is going.

Continuous Delivery as described in the book is a technical practice and approach to the engineering of high-quality software systems. Continuous Delivery as a discipline extends beyond the range of test and deployment automation. For an organisation to achieve "the Continuous Delivery of ideas into production in the form of useful software" takes excellence in organisational, cultural and technical performance. 

The State of DevOps report, and the Accelerate Book, have built on this model and the combination of these ideas represent a significant strengthening in genuine Engineering practice around the development of software systems.

CD is a practice that changes organisations for the better. 

What will the next 10 years of Continuous Delivery look like?
