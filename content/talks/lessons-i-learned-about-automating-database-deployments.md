### 

No one enjoys a 4+ hour database deployment. It is always some random script which causes the push to production to grind to a halt. I've been there, I felt that pain. I was also on the team who automate database deployments at a bank and for an election software vendor. By doing so we went from multi-hour deployments to 10-minute deployments. But it was more than just the tooling, it was about shifting the mindset and changing the culture.

In this talk, I will walk through the process which was put together for each company, and the decisions we made each step of the way. Learn the mistakes I made, how I went about building trust in the process, and the benefits each company saw as a result.
