All organizations want to go faster and decrease friction in delivering software. The problem is that InfoSec has historically slowed this down or worse. But, with the rise of CD pipelines and new devsecops tooling, there is an opportunity to reverse this trend and move Security from being a blocker to being an enabler.

This talk will discuss hallmarks of doing security in a software delivery pipeline with an emphasis on being pragmatic. At each phase of the delivery pipeline, you will be armed with philosophy, questions, and tools that will get security up-to-speed with your software delivery cadence.
