We often think about speed and danger as being closely related, but we now have empirical proof that faster, smaller releases tend to cause fewer outages and less downtime for our software systems. How can we take that understanding and use it to build systems that allow for the fallibility of humans and systems? What makes speed safer, how can teams support each other with successful failures, and why do we hold to superstitions about control when we have proof to the contrary? 

Continuous Delivery requires that we are able to deploy broken code into production without negatively affecting anyone, but how do we make that change in our beliefs and our teams? This talk is for anyone struggling with the tension between quality, speed, and accuracy.

Audiences will leave with a new perspective on how small and fast a change can be, and how allowing change makes teams healthier.
